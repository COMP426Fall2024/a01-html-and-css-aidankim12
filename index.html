        There once was a man named Gold Roger, who was King of the Pirates. He
        had fame, power, and wealth beyond your wildest dreams. Before they hung
        him from the gallows, these were the final words he said:
      </p>
      <p>
        "My fortune is yours for the taking, but you'll have to find it first. I
        left everything I own in One Piece."

          I'm no <em>One Piece</em> expert. Heck, I learned a lot just making this
          website. None of the images are my own and most of the information
          came from
