          <h2>Origins</h2>
          <p>
            <em>One Piece</em> is a manga written Eiichiro Oda. It began
            publication in the <em>Weekly Shounen Jump</em> in 1997 and was
            adapted into an anime by <em>Toei Animations</em> just a few years
            after! Oda is very particular about public appearances. Most
            pictures you'll find of him are extremely outdated. Pictured to the
            right is the caricature he uses for weekly comments from authors.

          <h2>Synopsis</h2>
          <p>
            Gold Roger's words (as seen on the home page) sent the people of the
            One Piece world into a frenzy in search of his treasure which was
            hidden in the Grand Line. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy who
            dreams of becoming the king of the pirates. With the power of the
            Gum-Gum fruit, he sets sail for the Grand Line at the age of 17 and
            forms his crew, the Strawhat Pirates. There he makes many new
            friends and encounters dangerous enemies.

          <h2>Why should you watch it?</h2>
          <p>
            You probably spend too much time watching tik tok and instagram
            reels anyways. Watch two episodes a day and you might be able to
            catch up in two or three years. More seriously, it's a pretty
            interesting anime (in my opinion). If you are interested in
            starting, I think they're reanimating the series which you might
            find more enjoyable when it releases.
